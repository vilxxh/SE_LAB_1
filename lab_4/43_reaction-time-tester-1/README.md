# Real-Time Reaction Time Tester

This project is a terminal-based reaction time tester using **Pygame**. It introduces students to interactive game design using object-oriented principles and real-time graphical rendering.

---

## What’s Provided

A partially working version of a reaction time tester with:

- A grey "wait" screen that turns green at a random moment
- Click (or press `Space`) as fast as possible once it turns green
- A running average reaction time and round counter

You are expected to **analyze**, **interact with an AI assistant**, and **complete/fix** the game to make it fully functional.

### **Use an LLM (e.g. ChatGPT or Claude) as your debugging and pair-programming partner for this lab.**

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Clone the repo or download the project folder.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Tasks to Complete

Each task must be completed using an iterative process involving LLM suggestions and your critical code review.

### Task 1: Refine Input Timing Detection

> Reaction times are measured from when the round *started*, not from when the screen actually turned green - so every recorded time is inflated by however long the wait phase lasted, and clicking during the grey "wait" screen gets timed and recorded exactly like a real reaction instead of being flagged as a false start. Investigate and enhance input handling so only genuine reactions after "go" are recorded, measured from the moment "go" happened.


### Task 2: Implement Game Over Condition

> Add a screen that displays the final results (every reaction time and the average) once all rounds are complete, then gracefully waits for input instead of just printing to the console.


### Task 3: Add Replay Option

> After the results screen, allow the user to play again by choosing a difficulty (Easy, Medium, or Hard wait-time range/round count), or exit.


### Task 4: Add Sound Feedback

> Add basic sound effects for the "go" cue, a false start, and the session ending.

## Expected Behavior

- Each round starts with a grey screen for a random, unpredictable delay
- The screen turns green at a random moment, at which point the player should click or press `Space` as fast as possible
- Reacting after "go" records and displays that round's reaction time in milliseconds
- Reacting before "go" should be treated as a false start rather than a valid time
- After a short pause, the next round begins automatically; the session ends after the configured number of rounds

## Submission Checklist

Submission is only the following three things:

- [] A 10-second video of gameplay **before** your changes, showing the bug/broken behavior
- [] A 10-second video of gameplay **after** your changes, showing the bug fixed and the new features working
- [] The Chat/LLM used page link, with the complete chat history
